## üìñ Overview

As IoT devices proliferate, the need for security becomes critical. With an estimated **29.42 billion IoT devices** by 2030, addressing potential threats to connected systems is essential. This project demonstrates IoT security solutions using **STM32U575ZIT6Q** and **AWS IoT Core**, focusing on secure data transmission, device authentication, and robust cloud management.

## üåê Why IoT Security?

- **Rising IoT Attacks:** IoT devices have become prime targets for cyber-attacks, making secure protocols essential.
- **Scalability:** AWS IoT Core supports scaling with cost-effective solutions, meeting the needs of millions of connected devices.
- **Customer-Centric Security**: Inspired by AWS‚Äôs principle
>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not competitor obsessed, we‚Äôre customer obsessed‚Äù

This project prioritizes user security and data protection.

## üîß Components & Capabilities

### STM32U575ZIT6Q Security Features
- **Advanced Cryptography**: Built-in cryptographic capabilities for secure data handling.
- **TLS 1.2 Support**: Ensures data integrity and privacy over network connections.
